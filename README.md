# youtube-open

Small Perl script to open the https://youtube.com/... url for a downloaded [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) file.

## Example usage
```
youtube-open "Functional Programming Principles in Elixir  - Elixir Louisville-Zee4bbsDvrA.mkv"
```

The script is exceedingly simple. For now it only works with Firefox.

This is in no way related to YouTube.
